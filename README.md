## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Run `python main.py`
2. Enter a user ID (or press Enter for 'demo_user')
3. Start chatting! The agent will remember your preferences and past conversations

### Memory Features
The agent automatically:
- Stores your investment preferences and risk tolerance
- Remembers your financial goals and timeline
- Recalls past conversations and advice given
- Provides personalized recommendations based on your history

### Testing Memory
Run the test scripts to see memory functionality:
```bash
# Test memory within single session
python test_memory.py

# Test persistence across application restarts
python test_persistence.py
```

### Memory Persistence
âœ… **Automatic Persistence**: The agent now uses SQLite + InMemoryStore hybrid:
- **Conversation history** persists across application restarts
- **User memories** are automatically saved to SQLite database
- **Fast performance** during active sessions with InMemoryStore
- **User isolation** - each user gets their own secure memory space

A `wealth_agent_memories.db` file will be created automatically in your project directory.

See `MEMORY.md` for detailed memory system documentation.
