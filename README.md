## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Run `python main.py`
2. Enter a user ID (or press Enter for 'demo_user')
3. Start chatting! The agent will remember your preferences and past conversations

### Memory Features
The agent automatically:
- Stores your investment preferences and risk tolerance
- Remembers your financial goals and timeline
- Recalls past conversations and advice given
- Provides personalized recommendations based on your history

### Portfolio & Trading Features (Optional)
With Alpaca API setup, the agent can:
- **Portfolio Analysis:**
  - Access your real portfolio positions and holdings
  - Provide account summary and performance data
  - Give personalized advice based on your actual investments
  - Track portfolio changes and performance over time
  - Analyze individual positions and suggest optimizations

- **Order Execution:**
  - Place market orders for immediate execution at current market prices
  - Set limit orders to buy/sell at specific target prices
  - Create stop orders for risk management and automated selling
  - Trade both stocks (AAPL, TSLA, etc.) and cryptocurrencies (BTC/USD, ETH/USD)
  - Use fractional shares or specify dollar amounts for flexible position sizing
  - View order history, status, and cancel pending orders
  - All trading happens in paper trading mode by default for safety

### Testing
Run the test scripts to verify functionality:
```bash
# Test memory within single session
python test_memory.py

# Test persistence across application restarts
python test_persistence.py

# Test Alpaca portfolio integration
python test_alpaca.py

# Test Alpaca trading functionality (stocks & crypto)
python test_alpaca_trading.py
```

### Memory Persistence
âœ… **Automatic Persistence**: The agent now uses SQLite + InMemoryStore hybrid:
- **Conversation history** persists across application restarts
- **User memories** are automatically saved to SQLite database
- **Fast performance** during active sessions with InMemoryStore
- **User isolation** - each user gets their own secure memory space

A `wealth_agent_memories.db` file will be created automatically in your project directory.

See `MEMORY.md` for detailed memory system documentation.

## Alpaca Setup (Optional)

To enable portfolio and trading features:

1. **Sign up for Alpaca**: Visit [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets/) and create an account
2. **Get API keys**: Go to Paper Trading section and generate API key and secret
3. **Add to .env**: Copy credentials to your `.env` file
4. **Test connection**: Run `python test_alpaca.py` to verify portfolio setup
5. **Test trading**: Run `python test_alpaca_trading.py` to verify trading functionality

### Trading Safety & Configuration

- **Paper Trading by Default**: Set `ALPACA_PAPER_TRADING=true` (default) for risk-free simulation
- **Real Trading**: Only enable live trading (`ALPACA_PAPER_TRADING=false`) after thorough testing
- **Order Confirmation**: The agent will always confirm order details before execution
- **Risk Management**: Start with small amounts and understand the risks involved

### Supported Assets

- **Stocks**: All major US equities (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, etc.)
- **Crypto**: Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD), and 20+ other cryptocurrencies
- **Fractional Trading**: Buy partial shares or specify dollar amounts
- **24/7 Crypto**: Cryptocurrency trading available around the clock

The agent works without Alpaca - portfolio and trading features are optional but provide much more personalized advice and capabilities.

**Important:** All responses are for educational purposes only and not financial advice. Trading involves risk of loss.
