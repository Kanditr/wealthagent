## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Run `python main.py`
2. Enter a user ID (or press Enter for 'demo_user')
3. Start chatting! The agent will remember your preferences and past conversations

### Memory Features
The agent automatically:
- Stores your investment preferences and risk tolerance
- Remembers your financial goals and timeline
- Recalls past conversations and advice given
- Provides personalized recommendations based on your history

### Portfolio Features (Optional)
With Alpaca API setup, the agent can:
- Access your real portfolio positions and holdings
- Provide account summary and performance data
- Give personalized advice based on your actual investments
- Track portfolio changes and performance over time
- Analyze individual positions and suggest optimizations

### Testing
Run the test scripts to verify functionality:
```bash
# Test memory within single session
python test_memory.py

# Test persistence across application restarts
python test_persistence.py

# Test Alpaca portfolio integration
python test_alpaca.py
```

### Memory Persistence
âœ… **Automatic Persistence**: The agent now uses SQLite + InMemoryStore hybrid:
- **Conversation history** persists across application restarts
- **User memories** are automatically saved to SQLite database
- **Fast performance** during active sessions with InMemoryStore
- **User isolation** - each user gets their own secure memory space

A `wealth_agent_memories.db` file will be created automatically in your project directory.

See `MEMORY.md` for detailed memory system documentation.

## Alpaca Setup (Optional)

To enable portfolio features:

1. **Sign up for Alpaca**: Visit [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets/) and create an account
2. **Get API keys**: Go to Paper Trading section and generate API key and secret
3. **Add to .env**: Copy credentials to your `.env` file
4. **Test connection**: Run `python test_alpaca.py` to verify setup

The agent works without Alpaca - portfolio features are optional but provide much more personalized advice.
